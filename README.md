# Histogram-Equalization
Here I have implemented histogram equalization without using any off-the-shelf histogram equalization function.

Tasks covered in this notebook:
1. Calculating an image's normalized intensity histogram 𝑝𝑟(𝑟𝑘) and plotting its intensity histogram.
2. Calculating the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of 𝑝𝑟(𝑟𝑘) and plotting it.
3. Applying the intensity transformation function to the input image, we will obtain the histogram-equalized output image.
4. Calculating the normalized intensity histogram of the output image 𝑝𝑠(𝑟𝑠) and plotting it.
